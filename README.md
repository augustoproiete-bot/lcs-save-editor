## Extracting Save Files
In order to edit save files, you'll need to extract them from your console or
mobile device.

### Android
  - You'll need a rooted device to access save files.
  - Save files are located at `/data/data/com.rockstargames.gtalcs/files/`

### iOS:
  - You'll need a jailbroken device to access save files if you're using iOS 8.3
    or newer.
  - Save files are located in the Documents folder.

### PS2
  - You'll need a cheat device, memory card reader, or a softmodded console to
    extract save files from the memory card.
  - If you're using PCSX2, use
    [mymc](http://www.csclub.uwaterloo.ca:11068/mymc/) to access the files on
    the virtual memory card.
  - You may need to use a tool like
    [PS2 Save Builder](https://www.ps2savetools.com/download/ps2-save-builder/)
    to access the raw files depending on how the save was extracted.

### PSP
  - PSP saves are encrypted, so you'll have to decrypt them before the save
    editor will be able to read them. You can use PPSSPP, the PSP emulator, to
    decrypt saves.
    1) Download and install [PPSSPP](http://ppsspp.org/)
    2) Boot GTA:LCS in the emulator, play through the first mission, and save
       the game. This is done to create the save directory.
    3) Locate the GTA:LCS save directory by navigating to
       `<documents>/PPSSPP/memstick/PSP/SAVEDATA/<game_id>/`
    4) Overwrite the contents of that directory with the save you want to edit.
    5) Disable save encryption
        - Open the following file in a text editor:
          `<documents>/PPSSPP/memstick/PSP/SYSTEM/ppsspp.ini`
        - In the [SystemParam] section, add the following line:
          `EncryptSave = False`
        - Restart PPSSPP
    6) Boot up GTA:LCS, load your save, and save it again in a different slot.
    7) Your decrypted save file will be loacted at
       `<documents>/PPSSPP/memstick/PSP/SAVEDATA/<game_id>/DATA.BIN`
